# SuperCollider
My SuperCollider Codes


## What is this?

This repository keeps all my code safe and makes sure I can go back an forth between versions of the scripts.

## Run code locally

Clone the repo and open the preferred .scd in Supercollider.
Boot the server by pressing cmd + B.

## Konsert Class

Many of the concert scripts depend on the class Konsert. This needs to be cloned separately and saved in
```
/Users/someusername/Library/Application Support/SuperCollider/Extensions/
```

Compile the class library and you are good to go.
